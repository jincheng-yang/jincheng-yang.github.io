# Solution curve and flow map

$$

\newcommand{\bu}{\boldsymbol u}
\newcommand{\bF}{\boldsymbol F}
\newcommand{\bf}{\boldsymbol f}
$$

The graph of a solution $u: I \to \R$ to an ODE is called a **solution curve** or **trajectory**. Suppose the ODE is a one dimensional dynamic system:

$$
	u' (t) = f (t, u (t)).
$$

Pick $t \in I$ and $x = u (t)$. Then the tangent vector of a solution passing $(t, x)$ is $(1, u' (t)) = (1, f (t, x))$. The solution curve is tangent to the vector field $(1, f (t, x))$ everywhere.

We will show soon that under suitable conditions, a dynamic system coupled with an initial datum admits a unique solution.

$$
	\begin{cases}
		\bu ' (t) = \bf (t, \bu (t)) \\
		\bu (t _0) = \bx _0
	\end{cases}
	\iff
	\begin{cases}
		\dot \bx = \bf _t (\bx) \\
		\bx \at{t = t _0} = \bx _0
	\end{cases}
$$

A **flow map** is a function $\Phi$ is defined by $\Phi (t; t _0, x _0) = \bu (t)$ if $\bu (t)$ is the solution to this dynamic system with initial datum.

### Comparison lemma

> $$
> 	u' (t) = f (t, u (t)), \qquad v' (t) = g (t, v (t))

> and $u (t _0) > v (t _0)$, then $u (t) > v (t)$ for every $t > t _0$. Accordingly, if $u (t _0) < v (t _0)$, then $u (t) < v (t)$ for every $t < t _0$.
