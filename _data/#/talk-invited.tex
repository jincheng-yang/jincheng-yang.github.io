\talk{New Estimates on the Second Derivatives of the 3D Navier-Stokes Equation}{2021-05-02}{San Francisco State University (zoom talk)}{AMS Spring Western Sectional Meeting}{Special Session on Nonlinear PDEs and Fluid Dynamics}{In this talk we present $L ^{4/3,q}$ local integrability of the second spatial derivatives of suitable solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation for any $q > \frac43$. This joint work with A. Vasseur improves the current result $L ^{4/3, \infty}$ (Lions, 1996), and it is based on a blow-up technique using the universal scaling along approximated Lagrangian trajectories. Locally, we can obtain any regularity of the vorticity without any a priori knowledge of the pressure. The local-to-global step uses a recently constructed maximal function for transport equations.}
