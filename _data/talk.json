            "Abstract": "We study the inviscid damping of Couette flow with an exponentially stratified density. The optimal decay rates of the velocity field and the density are obtained for general perturbations with minimal regularity. For Boussinesq approximation model, the decay rates we get are consistent with the previous results in the literature. We also study the decay rates for the full Euler equations of stratified fluids, which were not studied before. For both models, the decay rates depend on the Richardson number in a very similar way. Besides, we also study the dispersive decay due to the exponential stratification when there is no shear.

            "Abstract": "When studying the large-scale movement of the ocean water and atmosphere, earth rotation may affect the stability of the fluid significantly. Here we discuss the linear stability of an homogeneous inviscid incompressible shear flow on a rotating frame near equator. Coriolis effect will be taken into consideration. The goal of this seminar is to illustrate how to show linear stability and instability of such a flow. As an example, we present a thorough analysis of the sinusoidal shear flow, and point out a mistake in Kuo’s (1973) book. This is a joint work with Dr. Hao Zhu and our advisor Prof. Zhiwu Lin at Georgia Tech."

This talk will start with the intuition of stochastic integral, then introduce very informally the idea of martingale, and finally move to the core of SDE (stochastic differential equation): the famous Itô's lemma."

In his paper, he proposed a model for an SQG equation with different dissipation operators on two domains, corresponding to the ocean and the land, that partition the whole space. He constructed admissible weak solutions, and used De Giorgi method to show their Hölder continuity. He also bootstrapped to the optimal regularity in some cases. In this talk, I will focus on his De Giorgi part that proves the initial $C^α$ regularity, and show how he used a reflection method to deal with the main difficulty, the discrepancy in scaling."

            "Series": "Junior Analysis Seminar",
            "Abstract": "For a fluid equation, one way to obtain higher derivatives estimate is by scaling. In particular, we smoothen the flow, zoom in and center at the regularized trajectories, and obtain interior regularity in local frame, say in a unit cube. These cubes may look very different from each other in the global frame. I will present an interesting Vitali-type covering lemma for these cubes, and as a consequence I will show $W^{2,p}$ boundedness of suitable solutions to Navier-Stokes equation for $p < 4/3$."

            "Abstract": "We want to give second derivative estimate for the suitable weak solutions to three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with $L ^2$ initial data. Right now it is known that $\\nabla ^2 u$ is in the space of $L ^{\\frac43, \\infty}$ homogeneous in space-time. The limiting space $L ^{\\frac43}$, however, is unknown. In 2014, Choi and Vasseur gave an alternating proof for $L ^\\frac43$ weak integrability, where they used blow-up techniques along trajectories and De Giorgi methods. To do local analysis, they investigate solutions near a Eulerian cylindrical neighborhood of a given point. In this talk, I present a covering lemma for these Eulerian cylinders, which could bridge the gap between $L ^\\frac43$ weak and $L ^\\frac43$. We are now working on a refinement of the local analysis, which will be able to give the strict $L ^\\frac43$ integrability locally. <a href='/users/jcyang/assets/files/candidacy.pdf'>[Slides]</a>"

If time permits, we can look at a stability result for the inviscid Boussinesq system."

The true probability can differ from some nominal distribution by a distance R, where the distance between distributions can be characterized by the optimal mass transport, for instance Wasserstein distance. In this talk, we will explore the duality principle for this estimate, and we can discuss the worst case distribution for the discrete case if time permits."

This operator gives a Lipschitz extension for a function defined on a discrete subset of metric space to the whole space. The extension is based on the Shapley theorem, which comes from the Nash equilibrium in the game theory. We will give an application of the Shapley extension in 1-Wasserstein robust optimization problem. This is a joint work with Gao and Zhang."
