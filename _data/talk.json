            "Abstract": "In this talk, we consider the inhomogeneous Landau equation with softness parameter $\\gamma$ between $\\sqrt3$ and $2$. We show the existence of solutions that arise from smooth, strictly positive initial data but that develop a finite time singularity. The singularity manifests as a Type II implosion for the mass, momentum, and energy of the system. The hydrodynamic fields blow up with a self-similar profile that asymptotically matches smooth implosion singularities of the compressible Euler equations. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of a collisional kinetic model which is globally well-posed in the homogeneous setting, but admits finite time singularities for inhomogeneous data. This talk is based on an ongoing joint work with several collaborators."

The decision maker's goal is to find an optimal end-to-end policy that directly outputs a decision for any new context. We propose a distributionally robust formulation based on the causal transport distance, which preserves the conditional information structure of random problem parameters given the value of covariates. We derive a dual reformulation and study its regularization effect. We prove that the infinite-dimensional policy optimization admits a finite-dimensional convex programming equivalent reformulation. This result renders a new class of optimal policy for adjustable robust optimization."

We construct a maximal function associated with geometric objects that we call skewed cylinders, appearing in inviscid flows like the Eulerian cylinders around the Lagrangian trajectories. We also apply the blow-up method to estimate the boundary vorticity, which enables us to achieve an unconditional control of the layer separation of Leray--Hopf solutions from a steady shear flow in a finite periodic channel. <a href='/assets/files/doctoral-slides.pdf'>[Slides]</a>"

In this talk, we will present a new estimate on the discrepency between a Navier-Stokes solution and a static Euler solution albeit the inviscid limit may fail. This is the first unconditional result from the positive side, and the bound is near sharp as suggested by convex integration."

We also study the decay rates for the full Euler equations of stratified fluids, which were not studied before. For both models, the decay rates depend on the Richardson number in a very similar way.
