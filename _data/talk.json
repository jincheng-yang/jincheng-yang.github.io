We establish various analytical and quantitative convergence results for the long time behaviour of the mean-field system and related numerical illustrations are also provided."

I will present new mathematical tools that provide deeper insights into the partial regularity of the Navier-Stokes equation and general supercritical systems. We derive nonlinear a priori estimates and trace estimates for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which extend the current picture of higher derivative estimates in the mixed norm.

The decision maker's goal is to find an optimal end-to-end policy that directly outputs a decision for any new context. We propose a distributionally robust formulation based on the causal transport distance, which preserves the conditional information structure of random problem parameters given the value of covariates. We derive a dual reformulation and study its regularization effect. We prove that the infinite-dimensional policy optimization admits a finite-dimensional convex programming equivalent reformulation. This result renders a new class of optimal policy for adjustable robust optimization."

We construct a maximal function associated with geometric objects that we call skewed cylinders, appearing in inviscid flows like the Eulerian cylinders around the Lagrangian trajectories. We also apply the blow-up method to estimate the boundary vorticity, which enables us to achieve an unconditional control of the layer separation of Leray--Hopf solutions from a steady shear flow in a finite periodic channel. <a href='/~yang/assets/files/doctoral-slides.pdf'>[Slides]</a>"

In this talk, we will present a new estimate on the discrepency between a Navier-Stokes solution and a static Euler solution albeit the inviscid limit may fail. This is the first unconditional result from the positive side, and the bound is near sharp as suggested by convex integration."

            "Abstract": "When studying the large-scale movement of the ocean water and atmosphere, earth rotation may affect the stability of the fluid significantly. Here we discuss the linear stability of an homogeneous inviscid incompressible shear flow on a rotating frame near equator. Coriolis effect will be taken into consideration. The goal of this seminar is to illustrate how to show linear stability and instability of such a flow. As an example, we present a thorough analysis of the sinusoidal shear flow, and point out a mistake in Kuo\u2019s (1973) book. This is a joint work with Dr. Hao Zhu and our advisor Prof. Zhiwu Lin at Georgia Tech."

            "Abstract": "We study the inviscid damping of Couette flow with an exponentially stratified density. The optimal decay rates of the velocity field and the density are obtained for general perturbations with minimal regularity. For Boussinesq approximation model, the decay rates we get are consistent with the previous results in the literature. We also study the decay rates for the full Euler equations of stratified fluids, which were not studied before. For both models, the decay rates depend on the Richardson number in a very similar way. Besides, we also study the dispersive decay due to the exponential stratification when there is no shear. <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08924'>[Paper]</a> <a href='http://www.rpubs.com/TeddyYJC/linear-damping'>[Slides]</a>"
