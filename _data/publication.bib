	abstract = {We consider the incompressible Navier--Stokes and Euler equations in a bounded domain with non-characteristic boundary condition, and study the energy dissipation near the outflow boundary in the zero-viscosity limit. We show that in a general setting, the energy dissipation rate is proportional to $\bar U \bar V ^2$, where $\bar U$ is the strength of the suction and $\bar V$ is the tangential component of the difference between Euler and Navier--Stokes on the outflow boundary. Moreover, we show that the enstrophy within a layer of order $\nu / \bar U$ is comparable with the total enstrophy. The rate of enstrophy production near the boundary is inversely proportional to $\nu$.},

@article{zhang2024b,
	abstract = { Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization has emerged as a recent topic with broader applications in operations research and machine learning. Various proofs have been presented in the literature, each differing in assumptions and levels of generality. In ``A Short and General Duality Proof for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization,'' Zhang, Yang, and Gao present a novel elementary proof that not only shortens existing frameworks but also offers surprising generalizations. Leveraging classical Legendre---Fenchel duality, they demonstrate that strong duality is contingent on a certain interchangeability principle. Moreover, they extend this duality result to encompass risk-averse optimization and globalized distributionally robust counterparts. },

@article{vasseur2024,
	abstract = { We provide an unconditional L2 upper bound for the boundary layer separation of Leray--Hopf solutions in a smooth bounded domain. By layer separation, we mean the discrepancy between a (turbulent) low-viscosity Leray--Hopf solution uν and a fixed (laminar) regular Euler solution u¯ with similar initial conditions and body force. We show an asymptotic upper bound C||u¯||L∞3T on the layer separation, anomalous dissipation, and the work done by friction. This extends the previous result when the Euler solution is a regular shear in a finite channel. The key estimate is to control the boundary vorticity in a way that does not degenerate in the vanishing viscosity limit. },

@article{zhang2024,
	abstract = { We study policy optimization for the feature-based newsvendor, which seeks an end-to-end policy that renders an explicit mapping from features to ordering decisions. Most existing works restrict the policies to some parametric class that may suffer from suboptimality (such as affine class) or lack of interpretability (such as neural networks). Differently, we aim to optimize over all functions of features. In this case, the classic empirical risk minimization yields a policy that is not well-defined on unseen feature values. To avoid such degeneracy, we consider a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework. This leads to an adjustable robust optimization, whose optimal solutions are notoriously difficult to obtain except for a few notable cases. Perhaps surprisingly, we identify a new class of policies that are proven to be exactly optimal and can be computed efficiently. The optimal robust policy is obtained by extending an optimal robust in-sample policy to unobserved feature values in a particular way and can be interpreted as a Lipschitz regularized critical fractile of the empirical conditional demand distribution. We compare our method with several benchmarks using synthetic and real data and demonstrate its superior empirical performance.This paper was accepted by J.
