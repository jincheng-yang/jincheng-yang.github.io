The angle between two pedals of a flower is not random. It is a golden section of the circle. At this angle $(3-\sqrt{5})\pi$, petals can spread out without overlapping, so that each petal is exposed to the sunshine.

These petals form a spiral shape. The number of spirals is always a Fibonacci number (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...). In the following coloring, you can identify 21 spirals.
