Usually, we define mathematical notions (spaces) by adding structure. Set plus topology is a topological space. Set plus $\sigma$-algebra (tribe) is a measurable space. Measurable space with a measure is a measure space, etc. However, there are times when notions can be defined by **forgetting structure**. 

> [!Definition]
> A topological space is called **Polish** if it is homeomorphic to a complete, separable metric space.

In this definition, we first equipped a set with a metric, which induces a topology, and then we forget about the metric. Hence we can also say, Polish space is a separable completely metrizable space.

It has the following siblings.

> [!Definition]
> A Hausdorff topological space is called **Lusin** if it is the image of a continuous bijection of a Polish space.
> 
> A Hausdorff topological space is called **Suslin** if it is the image of a continuous surjection of a Polish space.

In the following diagram, $(X, d)$ is a metric space, $\mathcal X$ is the induced topology. $(P, \mathcal P)$ is polish, $(L, \mathcal L)$ is Lusin, $(S, \mathcal S)$ is Suslin.

$$
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
	X & \Longleftrightarrow & P & \Longleftrightarrow & L & \Longrightarrow & S \\
	\mathcal X & \longleftrightarrow & \mathcal P & \longleftarrow & \mathcal L & \longleftarrow &\mathcal S
\end{array}
$$

Each topological space induces a Borel $\sigma$-algebra. Let $B \in \sigma (P)$ be a Borel measurable set. It is also a topological subspace with topology $\mathcal P \cap B$. 

> [!Definition]
> Topological space $(B, \mathcal P \cap B)$ is called a **Borel space**. 

>[!Warning]
>Not to be confused with **measurable space**, which is also called Borel space.

Now we use their topology to generate $\sigma$-algebra, and then forget about the topology.

>[!Definition]
>A measurable space $(P, \mathscr P)$ is called a **standard Borel space** if it is isomorphic to a Polish space $(P, \sigma (\mathcal P))$. That is, we can find a topology $\mathcal P$ on $P$ such that $\mathscr P$ is precisely the Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by this topology.

>A measurable space $(B, \mathscr B)$ is called a **substandard Borel space** if it is isomorphic to a subspace of a standard Borel space. That is, you can find $(P, \mathscr P)$ such that $\mathscr B = B \cap \mathscr P$. Note that $B$ does not need to be in $\mathscr P$.
>
>A substandard Borel space $(S, \mathscr S)$ is **analytic** if it is the image of a measurable map from a standard space. Equivalently, it is analytic if it is isomorphic to a Suslin space $(S, \sigma (\mathcal S))$.

$$
\begin{array}{cccccc}
	(P, \sigma (\mathcal P)) \\
	\Updownarrow \\
	(P, \mathscr P) && (B, \sigma (B \cap \mathcal Q)) & \hookrightarrow & (Q, \sigma (\mathcal Q)) \\
	\Downarrow && \Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(S, \mathscr S) & = & (B, \mathscr B) & \hookrightarrow & (Q, \mathscr Q) \\
	\Updownarrow \\
	(S, \sigma (\mathcal S))
\end{array}
$$

So, standard Borel space are Polish space forgetting topology; substandard Borel space are Borel space forgetting topology (there is a small difference because now substandard Borel space does not need to be a Borel set of the ambient space); analytic space are Suslin space forgetting topology.

Suppose $(S, \mathcal S)$ is a Suslin space, then there exists a Polish space $(P, \mathcal P)$ and a continuous surjection $\pi: P \to S$. It is also Borel measurable: $(P, \mathscr P) \to (S, \mathscr S)$. Any open set $A \in \mathcal S$, has a preimage $\pi \inv (A) \in \mathcal P$ which is an open subset of $P$. Since $\pi: \pi \inv (A) \to A$ is surjective and measurable, $A$ is Suslin, aka analytic. Therefore, $\mathscr S = \sigma (\mathcal S) \subset \mathcal A (S)$, the analytic $\sigma$-algebra, aka $\sigma$-algebra generated by all analytic subset.

$$
\begin{array}{cccccc}
	(\pi \inv (A), \sigma (\pi ^* \mathcal A)) && (P, \sigma (\mathcal P)) \\
	\Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(\pi \inv (A), \pi ^* \mathscr A) && (P, \mathscr P) && (B, \sigma (B \cap \mathcal Q)) & \hookrightarrow & (Q, \sigma (\mathcal Q)) \\
	\Downarrow && \Downarrow && \Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(A, \mathscr A) & \hookrightarrow & (S, \mathscr S) & = & (B, \mathscr B) & \hookrightarrow & (Q, \mathscr Q) \\
	\Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(A, \sigma(\mathcal A)) && (S, \sigma (\mathcal S))
\end{array}
$$


Suppose $A \subset S$ is an analytic subset. Then it is the image of some Polish space $(B, \mathcal B)$. 

$$
\begin{array}{cccccc}
	(B, \sigma (\mathcal B)) && (P, \sigma (\mathcal P)) \\
	\Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(B, \mathscr B) && (P, \mathscr P)  \\
	\Downarrow && \Downarrow && \\
	(A, \mathscr A) & \hookrightarrow & (S, \mathscr S)  \\
	\Updownarrow && \Updownarrow \\
	(A, \sigma(\mathcal A)) && (S, \sigma (\mathcal S))
\end{array}
$$
