Conjugate circles are two set of circles, such that every circle from the first set is perpendicular with any circle from the second set of circles at their two intersections.

It looks like the magnetic field on Earth. You can move the cursor to change the direction and density of the circles.


<div class="pde" style="max-width:600px">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/users/jcyang/plugin/processing.min.js"></script>
<canvas data-processing-sources="/users/jcyang/assets/files/pde/electromagniticField.pde"></canvas>
</div>

Hover you mouse on the graph to adjust direction and density.
