This is the first program I wrote with Processing. It can draw Mandelbrot set in a simple way. You can press the mouse button to zoom in or out, and change the speed with your keyboard.
Mandelbrot set is the set of c's which its related series

\$z _c(0) = 1;\$

\$z _c(n) = z _c(n-1)^2 + c, \forall n \in \mathbf{N}^*.\$

in the complex plane. The black section in the picture is the Mandelbrot set.
