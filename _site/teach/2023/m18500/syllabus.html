<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>

<p>Math 18500 is the third in a sequence of mathematics courses for physical sciences majors. It covers differential equations: first and second-order ODE, systems of ODE, damped oscillators and resonance, Fourier series and Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, and solutions of the heat and wave equations. These equations help understand many evolutionary physics models.</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h3>

<p>You will learn how to solve some first-order ODEs, second-order linear ODEs, higher-order linear systems, and simple PDEs such as heat and wave equations. In addition, you will learn how to utilize some of the essential mathematical toolboxes including linear operators, Fourier series, and Laplace transforms. This course is not proof-based. Gaining intuition is more important than writing rigorous proofs.</p>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>

<p>The textbook for the course is <em>Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences</em>, by Mary Boas (3rd edition). This book will be helpful to you as a reference and also as a source of additional practice problems.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>The total grade for this course is 100 points. Your grade will be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 homework: 2 pts each, 12 pts total (the lowest score will be dropped)</li>
  <li>2 in-class exams: 26 pts each, 52 pts total</li>
  <li>1 final exam: 36 pts</li>
</ul>

<p>The course grade lines will be adjusted based on the distribution of scores in the course, but will be no more strict than the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <td>A: 91–100 </td>
        <td>A-: 87–90.99</td>
        <td>B+: 83–87.99</td>
        <td> B: 79–83.99 </td>
        <td> B-: 75–78.99 </td>
        <td> C+: 70–74.99 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> </td>
        <td>C: 65–69.99</td>
        <td>C-: 60–64.99</td>
        <td>D+: 55–59.99</td>
        <td>D: 50–54.99</td>
        <td> F: 0–49.99</td>
        <td> </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>The first two late homework can be accepted for up to 48 hours without punishment. Additional late submissions will be rejected. You can collaborate with your classmates in small study groups of up to 3 members. If you do so, please mark at the beginning of each assignment the full name of your collaborators. Each member still needs to submit their own solution. Homework submission will be via canvas. You are responsible for submitting a legible scan of your written solutions.</p>

<h3 id="final-exam">Final exam</h3>

<p>The time and location of the final exam will be announced in Week 3 or 4.
It is the policy of the Department of Mathematics that the following rules apply to final exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses: The Final Exam MUST occur at the time and place designated on the College Final Exam Schedule. Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the final exam except in the cases of an Incomplete.</p>

<h2 id="covid-19">COVID-19</h2>

<h3 id="uchicago-health-pact">UChicago Health Pact</h3>

<p>All students on campus are required to adhere to the guidelines in the UChicago Health Pact in order to promote a safe environment in the classroom. For the most up-to-date information on University policies, visit: https://goforward.uchicago.edu.</p>

<p>Any concerns over inappropriate PPE usage, physical distancing, cleaning/disinfection, or other COVID-19 related public health concerns should be directed to UCAIR.</p>

<p>If there is an emergency, call (773) 702-8181 or dial 123 on any campus phone.</p>

<p>If you were potentially exposed to COVID-19 or your COVID-19 test results come back positive, reach out immediately to: C19HealthReport@uchicago.edu Follow whatever subsequent instructions you receive from this team of medical professionals.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>Students who have been exposed to or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact UChicago Student Wellness immediately to be tested, and reach out to their area Dean of Students to request accommodations for classes as instructed here: https://goforward.uchicago.edu.</p>

<h2 id="zoom-protocols">Zoom protocols</h2>

<p>We do not expect to use Zoom in this course. However, in the unfortunate situation when the instructor is quarantined, we ask the following:</p>

<p>There is an expectation that students in this course will be actively engaged and on camera while on Zoom. If a student requires an exception, they will need to reach out to the instructor directly.</p>

<h3 id="recording-and-deletion-policies">Recording and Deletion Policies</h3>

<p>The Recording and Deletion Policies for the current academic year can be found in the Student Manual under Petitions, Audio &amp; Video Recording on Campus.
Do not record, share, or disseminate any course sessions, videos, transcripts, audio, or chats. 
Do not share links for the course to those not currently enrolled.
Any Zoom cloud recordings will be automatically deleted 90 days after the completion of the recording.</p>

<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>

<p>The University of Chicago takes academic honesty very seriously. Students are expected to be independently familiar with the university policy and to understand that their work in the course must be their own original work. Violations of the policy are taken seriously.</p>

<h2 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h2>

<p>The University of Chicago is committed to ensuring equitable access to our academic programs and services. Students with disabilities who have been approved for the use of academic accommodations by Student Disability Services (SDS) and need a reasonable accommodation(s) to participate fully in this course should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Timely notifications are required in order to ensure that your accommodations can be implemented. Please meet with me to discuss your access needs in this class after you have completed the SDS procedures for requesting accommodations.</p>
