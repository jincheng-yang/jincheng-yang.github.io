<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>

<p>Math 18500 is the third in a sequence of mathematics courses for physical sciences majors. It covers differential equations: first and second-order ODE, systems of ODE, damped oscillators and resonance, Fourier series and Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, and solutions of the heat and wave equations. These equations help understand many evolutionary physics models.</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h3>

<p>You will learn how to solve some first-order ODEs, second-order linear ODEs, higher-order linear systems, and simple PDEs such as heat and wave equations. In addition, you will learn how to utilize some of the essential mathematical toolboxes including linear operators, Fourier series, and Laplace transforms. This course is not proof-based. Gaining intuition is more important than writing rigorous proofs.</p>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>

<p>The textbook for the course is <em>Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences</em>, by Mary Boas (3rd edition). This book will be helpful to you as a reference and also as a source of additional practice problems.</p>

<h2 id="policies">Policies</h2>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>The total grade for this course is 100 points. Your grade will be based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7 homework: 2 pts each, 12 pts total (the lowest score will be dropped)</li>
  <li>2 in-class exams: 26 pts each, 52 pts total</li>
  <li>1 final exam: 36 pts</li>
</ul>

<p>The course grade lines will be adjusted based on the distribution of scores in the course, but will be no more strict than the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td> A: 90–100 </td>
        <td> B: 80–89.9 </td>
        <td> C: 70–79.9 </td>
        <td> D: 60–69.9 </td>
        <td> F: 0–59.9</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>

<p>The first two late homework can be accepted for up to 48 hours without punishment. Additional late submissions will be rejected. You can collaborate with your classmates in small study groups of up to 3 members. If you do so, please mark at the beginning of each assignment the full name of your collaborators. Each member still needs to submit their own solution. Homework submission will be via canvas. You are responsible for submitting a legible scan of your written solutions.</p>

<h3 id="final-exam">Final exam</h3>

<p>The time and location of the final exam will be announced in Week 3 or 4.
It is the policy of the Department of Mathematics that the following rules apply to final exams in all undergraduate mathematics courses: The Final Exam MUST occur at the time and place designated on the College Final Exam Schedule. Instructors are not permitted to excuse students from the scheduled time of the final exam except in the cases of an Incomplete.</p>
